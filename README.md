# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview 
As A Data Analyst for PyBer, a Python based ride sharing app company, my assignment is to perform an exploratory analysis on PyBer ride sharing data by creating visualizations showcasing the relationship between the # of drivers, # of rides, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver and their city type i.e., Urban, Suburban and Rural. The analysis and visualizations will help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
I created A PyBer summary DataFrame to showcase my finding:

With the PyBer summary DataFrame we can see that Urban city types produced about 62.7% of total fares, while 30.5% of fares from Suburban city types and 6.8% of fares from Rural city types. We can also see that about 80.9% of PyBer drivers are in Urban city types, while Suburban city types have an estimated 16.5% of PyBer drivers and Rural city types only 2.6%. See pie charts below:

We can also notice that the Average fare per ride runs an estimated $10 more in Urban cities compared to Rural city types while the Average Fare per Driver is about 3 times more in Rural city types compared to the Average Fare per Driver in Urban city types. 

To further analyze the data, I then created a DataFrame and line graph to showcase the Total Fares earned per week by city type from January - April 2019. We can see that Urban city types make about 10 times more and Suburban city types make about 5 times more in weekly fares compared to rural city types.

## Summary and Recommendations
Based on our findings and vizualizations 3 recommendations we can provide for the CEO:

1) Increase accessibilty to PyBer drivers by increasing the number of drivers in rural city types, the more drivers available the more likely the average fare per ride will decrease with the demand by having enough drivers to supply the demand. 

2)

3)
