# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview 
As a Data Analyst for PyBer, a Python based ride sharing app company, the assignment is to perform an exploratory analysis on PyBer ride sharing data by creating visualizations showcasing the relationship between the # of drivers, # of rides, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver and their city type i.e., Urban, Suburban and Rural. The analysis and visualizations will help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
I created A PyBer summary DataFrame to showcase my finding:

The PyBer summary DataFrame shows that Urban city types produced about 62.7% of total fares, while 30.5% of fares from Suburban city types and 6.8% of fares from Rural city types. We can also see that about 80.9% of PyBer drivers are in Urban city types, while Suburban city types have an estimated 16.5% of PyBer drivers and Rural city types only 2.6%. See pie charts below:

We can also notice that the Average fare per ride runs an estimated $10 more in Rural cities compared to Urban city types while the Average Fare per Driver is about 3 times more in Rural city types compared to the Average Fare per Driver in Urban city types.

To further analyze the data, I then created the "Total Fares by City Type" line graph to showcase the Total Fares earned per week by city type from January - April 2019. In terms of weekly fares, we can see that Urban cities earn about 10 times more while Suburban cities earn about 5 times more in weekly fares compared to rural cities.

During the 4-month period, Urban city types, represented by the yellow line graph, shows weekly fares totaling in a range of $1,600 to $2,400, while rural cities ranged from $67 to $500 and Suburban city types weekly total fares ranged from $700 to $1,400. The line graph further demonstrates similar peaks in fares in all three types of cities i.e., urban, suburban, and rural, occurring towards the end of February 2019.

## Summary and Recommendations
Based on our findings and visualizations, 3 recommendations we can provide for the CEO:

1) Increase PyBer ride sharing accessibility in Rural City types by increasing the number of drivers in rural cities. We notice a trend with urban city types, the more number of drivers the more total fares earned, as a result the majority of PyBer's revenue occurs in urban cities. If we increase the # of PyBer drivers in the Suburban and Rural city types, we increase customer access to PyBer services, increasing rides and as a result earn more fares.

2) The cost for Pyber ride sharing services is greater in rural cities, where the average fare per ride is about $35 while in Urban cities the average fare per ride is around $25, this shows us that as a ride share service has more drivers available the ride fares become cheaper on average. Implementing an incentive employment strategy/program to increase Pyber drivers in the rural and suburban city types will help drive down Average fares per ride. 

3) We also notice a peak in fares towards the end of February for all city types, I would advise to introduce a marketing campaign/promotion to further drive up PyBer ride sharing usage and as a result sales.

Overall, our analysis shows that there are significant difference in the number of rides, drivers, and fares according to their city type
