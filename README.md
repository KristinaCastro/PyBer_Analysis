# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview 
As a Data Analyst for PyBer, a Python based ride sharing app company, the assignment is to perform an exploratory analysis on PyBer ride sharing data by creating visualizations showcasing the relationship between the # of drivers, # of rides, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver and their city type i.e., Urban, Suburban and Rural. The analysis and visualizations will help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
I created A PyBer summary DataFrame to showcase my finding:

The PyBer summary DataFrame shows that Urban city types produced about 62.7% of total fares, while 30.5% of fares from Suburban city types and 6.8% of fares from Rural city types. We can also see that about 80.9% of PyBer drivers are in Urban city types, while Suburban city types have an estimated 16.5% of PyBer drivers and Rural city types only 2.6%. See pie charts below:

We can also notice that the Average fare per ride runs an estimated $10 more in Urban cities compared to Rural city types while the Average Fare per Driver is about 3 times more in Rural city types compared to the Average Fare per Driver in Urban city types. 

To further analyze the data, I then created a DataFrame and line graph to showcase the Total Fares earned per week by city type from January - April 2019. In terms of cost, we can see that Urban city types earn about 10 times more while Suburban city types earn about 5 times more in weekly fares compared to rural city types.

The "Total Fare by City Type" line chart further supports the PyBer Summary DataFrame by providing a visualization of the weekly total fares earned in rural, suburban, and urban cities between January 2019 and April 2019. Urban city types, represented by the yellow line graph, show Urban city fares totaled an average of $1,600 to $2,300 during the 4 month period while rural cities totaled around $300 from beginning to end during the same time period. The orange trend shows how the total fares in suruban cities fall in between urban and rural cities: around $700 to $1,300 from beginning to end during this time. The chart further demonstrates similar peak times in all these types of cities. One noteworthy peak in total fares among urban, suburban, and rural cities occurred sometime at the end of February 2019.

## Summary and Recommendations
Based on our findings and vizualizations 3 recommendations we can provide for the CEO:

1) Increase accessibilty in Rural City types by increasing the number of drivers in rural cities, the more drivers available the more likely the average fare per ride will decrease with the demand by having enough drivers to supply the demand. 

2)

3)
